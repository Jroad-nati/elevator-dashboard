##  I use these frameworks in this application for demonstration purposes. 
## The reason I chose these frameworks is that I currently use them at work.
- Vue
- Vite
- Quasar

## Assumption and usage
I pushed all the files to Git, including node_modules, to make it easier for you to test. This is a demonstration, and I had time limitations, but it needs refactoring and componentization for each function.

I didn't implement to handle many elevator request at a time.

## To run

npm run dev

It run on port  http://localhost:8089/
